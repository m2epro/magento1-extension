        You can <strong>Review Your Products</strong> before Listing them on Amazon or <strong>List Added Products Now</strong>. <br/>
        If you choose <b>List Added Products Now</b>, they will be Listed by the following procedure (sorted by priority):
        <ul class="list decorated-list">
            <li><span>Using ASIN/ISBN that has been assigned to the Magento Product via M2E Pro ASIN/ISBN Search Tool whether by Manual or Automatic Search.</span></li>
            <li><span>Using Listing Product Identifiers. This Option will be used by M2E Pro in case there were no ASIN/ISBN assigned via Search Tool, the Product Identifiers are valid and the respective Attributes of Magento Product contain the correct values</span></li>
            <li><span>Creating new ASIN/ISBN on Amazon. This method assumes that the Products, you are trying to list, have the assigned Product Type.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <b>Note:</b> This method can only be used by M2E Pro in case there is no way to link your Magento Product to the existing Amazon Product, i.e.  ASIN/ISBN was not set by via the Search Tool and the Listing Product Identifiers are not set.
