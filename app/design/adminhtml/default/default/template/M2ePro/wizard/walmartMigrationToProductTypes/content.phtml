            This M2E Pro version introduces important changes related to Walmartâ€™s new Item Spec 5.0.
            <br><br>

            To ensure that your Walmart integration continues to function smoothly and in full compliance with the new specifications, it's essential to update the Walmart category data in your M2E Pro.
            This update will align your product information with the latest Walmart requirements.
            <br><br>

            A new entity, Product Type, has also been introduced in this version. To list and update your products on Walmart, it is now essential to configure and assign a Product Type to each product.
            <br><br>

            Additionally, please note that if you had previously configured any Auto Add/Remove Rules for your M2E Pro Listings, these Rules will no longer be available after the migration to the new Walmart Item Spec 5.0.
            You will need to create new Rules to replace the old ones.
            <br><br>

            Please note, that this step is crucial for the seamless operation of your Walmart listings. By pressing OK, the system will automatically update the necessary data.
